# ðŸš€ Getting Started

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have completed the [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for your operating system before proceeding.

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. To start it, run the following command from the root of the OuterTune project:

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 3: Run the Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal and run one of the following commands:

### For Android:

```bash
npm run android
```

### For iOS:

```bash
npm run ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see OuterTune running on your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator. ðŸ“± You can also run it directly from Android Studio or Xcode if needed.
